This literally rescued this blog. GitHub Pages and Jekyll are awesome but the process of writing a new post can be a bit tedious.

Pressing dot (.) while in a GitHub repo main page is basically the same as changing the ".com" in the github url for a ".dev". It opens an in-broser editor based on Visual Studio Code, which happens to be a really good editor, and allows you to quickly make changes.

In combination with GitHub Pages and an [extension for markdown preview][markdown preview] it's the perfect tool for updating a blog.

There are still a couple details that could be easier, like drag-drop uploading images to a post, but I bet we soon will see extensions allowing these kind of things.
