Today is the release date for the newest version of apple's mobile OS, iOS 15.

This version is compatible with a device as old as the iPhone 6S, released in 2015, which is absolutely mind-blowing.

For contrast, the main competitor for the iPhone 6S was the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. A device which received official updates until Android 7, released only one year later.

I think things might be better right now on Android's side (not sure), but I can't believe there's people who can shit on Apple as an "obsolescense planner" while at the same time ignoring the Android alternatives that basically got outdated in only two years.

Don't get me wrong, there's a lot to criticize about Apple, but this kind of arguments are just a big hater red flag.
