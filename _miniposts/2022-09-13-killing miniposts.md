title: Not sure if killing miniposts?
categories: minipost

Today I converted some of the "miniposts" that were in this section back to normal posts.

I'm not entirely sure if I'm keeping this section honestly. But at the same time It makes sense to have a space for **really short** posts.

What's sure is that those posts were not small enough to be considered miniposts anymore.
